This is a developer's guide for AntClient. It assumes that you are already familiar with
the basic goals of the AntMonitor project. If not, please visit the
<a href="https://athinagroup.eng.uci.edu/projects/antmonitor">project website</a> and see our latest papers.

<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
    AntClient uses <a href="https://uci-networking-group.github.io/AntMonitorExample/">AntMonitorLib</a> to gain
    access to both real-time traffic and packets captured for off-line analysis. While the library
    takes care of routing packets, mapping, and logging them, AntClient can focus solely on the
    analysis side of the data. <br><br>

    <a href="#anteaterclient-block-diagram">Figure 1</a> shows what types
    of analysis AntClient currently does. The details of each analysis are implemented in the
    <a href="edu/uci/calit2/anteater/client/android/analysis/package-frame.html">analysis</a> package.
</p>

<p>
    The function calls in blue are API calls to the AntMonitorLib. To see their implementation
    details and the details of intercepting the network traffic, please see the
    <a href="../antmonitorlib/index.html" target="_blank">
        AntMonitorLib Developer's Guide
    </a>.
